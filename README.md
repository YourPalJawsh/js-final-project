# WEB 1430 Collaborative Final Project

---

For our final project, we want to pitch a browser based canvas to paint pixel art. It will be a simple grid of clickable pixels. The user will be able to paint the grids by being able to click individual pixels and will also be able to click and drag to paint in one stroke of the mouse. This will be managed by event listeners, and DOM, similar to the DOM puzzle lab. We will add a clear button to clear the canvas, and a save button to save the artwork. We will do this using LocalStorage, to save that data.

This project will have Event Handling, DOM manipulation, loops and conditionals, and local storage. Josh will be working on the grid/canvas logic, writing code for saving artwork via localstorage and if time permits, keeping artwork saved with sessionstorage to preserve it if the tab is accidently closed, and the event listeners to draw on the canvas once the logic for it is done. Josh will be in charge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make the browser based paint tool look clean, function well, and efficiently.
