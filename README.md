For our final project, we want to pitch a browser based canvas to paint pixel art. It will be a simple grid of clickable pixels. The user will be able to paint the grids by being able to click individual pixels and will also be able to click and drag to paint in one stroke of the mouse. This will be managed by event listeners, and DOM, similar to the DOM puzzle lab. We will add a clear button to clear the canvas, and a save button to save the artwork. We will do this using LocalStorage, to save that data. 

This project will include Event Handling, DOM manipulation, loops and conditionals, and local storage.
